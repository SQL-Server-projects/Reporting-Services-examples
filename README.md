## About
The following examples are provided to query both the database and report server. Additionally, I have included some helpful scripts and documents for reference.

## SSRS Reports

SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) enables the creation, deployment, and management of interactive, web-based reports. These reports provide a platform for sharing and configuring data, as well as delivering actionable insights. The examples below illustrate how to query both the database and the report server effectively.

## Power BI Dashboards

Power BI templates ensure that all reports adhere to a consistent design, maintaining a professional appearance that aligns with the organization's branding guidelines. By leveraging these templates, organizations can streamline reporting processes, foster collaboration, and create a polished, cohesive framework for data presentation. Standardized visuals and layouts minimize the risk of misrepresenting data or overlooking critical details. These templates also serve as a valuable starting point for new team members, reducing their learning curve and boosting productivity. Standardization helps stakeholders interpret data more effectively, reducing confusion and enhancing decision-making.

The log contains information on the length of time spent running a report's dataset query and the time spent processing the data. If you're a report server administrator, you can review the log information and identify long running tasks. You can also make suggestions to the report authors on the areas of the dataset or processing report they might be able to improve. </span>

The template also includes bookmarks for day, week, month, quarter, and year, enabling users to toggle the date timeline selection and control the X-axis date hierarchy level on the charts. It's a comprehensive visualization tool designed to provide deep insights into the performance, trends, and key metrics related to tickets generated within the ServiceNow platform. This dashboard offers a user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders, IT managers, and support teams to monitor, analyze, and optimize ticket management processes effectively.</span>

## Power BI External Tools

Power BI External Tools are additional applications or links to websites that integrate seamlessly with Power BI Desktop, enabling advanced modeling, debugging, optimization, and customization tasks. These tools extend Power BI's capabilities by providing specialized functionalities that are not natively available in the Power BI Desktop interface.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SQL-Server-projects/Reporting-Services-examples/master/Images/ReadMe/powerbi.external_tools.png" width="700px" >

The order of the buttons in the External Tools menu is determined alphabetically by the JSON file name. To manage this, I use a two-digit number prefix.

Place the .json files in the following directory: C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Power BI Desktop\External Tools

I used [base64-image.de](https://www.base64-image.de/) to generate Base64 Image code for icons. To create and modify the icons I used  GIMP.

You can find the JSON files in my [GitHub project here](https://github.com/SQL-Server-projects/Reporting-Services-examples/tree/master/Miscellaneous/External%20Tools). Please update the URLs in the JSON files to match your organization's sites for services like ServiceNow, Jira, and Confluence.
